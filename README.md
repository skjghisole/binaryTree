# Binary Tree

## This is my Implementation on how the binary tree works.

It has tree traversals and binary search

## How does this work? ðŸ¤”
So we currently have 4 endpoints for this

1. ```shell
/tree
```
Which returns a generated tree with a maximum of 10 nodes from 0 - 100 as default


2. ```shell
/tree/{value}
```
